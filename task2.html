            If you know me, you’d know how much I love incorporating seasonal fruits into my desserts. I think it’s such an interesting way to make the most of the season's fresh produce and make something fun and delicious out of it. And while I have made a lot of those over the years, this simple strawberry mousse has to be one of my absolute favourites! And for good reason - it’s eggless, quick, simple and uses just five ingredients and requires no baking.

        <ol>
            <li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed for 3-4 minutes.</li><br>
            <li> Whip cream until it reaches soft peak consistency.</li><br>
            <li>Add 4-5 tablespoons of strawberry compote and fold to combine. The amount of 
                strawberry compote can be adjusted to your liking. Keep swirls and streaks of 
                compote in the whipped cream by not fully mixing the cream and compote.</li><br>
            <li>Transfer this mixture into a piping bag with a star tip.</li><br>
            <li> Add a spoonful of compote into a small glass jar or tea glass. Pipe the mousse over it till the top. Cut a strawberry into half and place it on the side. Transfer to the fridge for 2-3 hours. Serve chilled!</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Gently fold the compote into the whipped cream and make sure to not mix it too thoroughly. Keeping a few swirls and streaks of the compote not only looks pretty but also adds a nice layer of flavour to the mousse. </li><br>
            <li>You can adjust the amount of compote you add to the whipped cream based on your personal preference. </li><br>
            <li>Refrigerate this mousse for a minimum of 2 to 3 hours before serving. This allows it to be completely set.</li><br>
            <li>Good heavy whipping cream brands in India to look for are Amul Whipping Cream, Elle & Vire, Arla and D'lecta. Stay away from Milky Mist Heavy Cream - awful flavour.</li><br>
